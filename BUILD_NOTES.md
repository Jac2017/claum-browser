# Claum build debug notes

Running log of failures and fixes. Newest at top. The scheduled task
`claum-build-watcher` reads this to pick up context between runs.

## Run #23 — triggered 2026-04-20 (commit a311924)

Run #22 made it past gn gen and into ninja (huge win!) but then failed
at 6m 45s with:
    ninja: error: '../../third_party/node/mac_arm64/node-darwin-arm64/bin/node',
           needed by 'gen/third_party/lit/v3_0/bundled/lit.rollup.js',
           missing and no known rule to make it

Chromium's JS bundler uses a Node binary that Google normally downloads
from GCS via a gclient hook, but ungoogled's privacy pruning strips it.

Fix applied in commit a311924: after the [5/6] Apply Claum patches step
(which is after all ungoogled pruning), stage the Homebrew-installed
node into the expected path. Using `install -m 0755` so it's executable.

This is also the official workaround suggested in the ungoogled-chromium
PR #2954 discussion: "create the link to node AFTER running the pruning
script, otherwise it will prune the link you made."

If #23 gets past this and hits more missing-binary errors, the same
pattern applies: any Google-hosted binary ungoogled pruned needs to be
staged back in AFTER the pruning step. Likely candidates:
  - third_party/llvm-build/Release+Asserts/bin/clang (use system clang)
  - third_party/rust-toolchain (use rustup)

## Run #22 — triggered 2026-04-20 (commit 4b1fad2)

Applied three fixes for the `DarwinFoundation1.modulemap missing` error
that killed run #21 (and earlier iterations):

1. `runs-on: macos-14` → `macos-15` — newer Xcode (16.3+) ships the
   numerically-suffixed modulemaps Chromium 146 references.
2. Added `use_clang_modules=false` and `treat_warnings_as_errors=false`
   to GN_ARGS in claum/scripts/build-mac.sh.
3. Added a pre-`gn gen` step in build-mac.sh that creates
   `<Name>1.modulemap -> <Name>.modulemap` symlinks in the SDK include
   dir for every non-numerically-suffixed modulemap. Belt-and-suspenders
   in case the gn args don't fully suppress the reference.

If run #22 still fails with modulemap errors → try patching
`buildtools/third_party/libc++/BUILD.gn` to drop the modulemap input
entirely. Last-resort option is `use_system_xcode=true`.

## Known-good fixes applied in previous runs

- `claum/scripts/fix-safe-browsing-gn.py` — two-fix helper that patches
  chrome/browser/safe_browsing/BUILD.gn after the ungoogled patch:
  - Fix #1: flip `if (false) {` → `if (true) {` inside
    `static_library("safe_browsing") { ... }` so the variable
    definitions (sources, deps, allow_circular_includes_from, configs,
    public_deps) actually execute.
  - Fix #2: insert `if (!defined(sources)) { sources = [] }` and the
    same for `deps` inside the inner `if (safe_browsing_mode != 0)`
    block, as a safety net.
